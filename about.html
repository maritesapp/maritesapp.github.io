					<h3>How is it different from other Social Media platforms?</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what's going on in
						the world, and to share and express what matters to them.
					</p>
					<p>Marites app, in contrary, is built with anonymity in mind. It's a place where you can post things
						that are "too risky to share". Either because it is considered taboo or the issue is something
						you dont want to be attached with your public image.
						Although you can <b>Follow</b> a certain account to see their posts, its not really meant to
						connect you with your close family and friends.
						<br /><br />
						What it intends to do is to allow one stranger to post some funny content, then allow bunch of
						other strangers to share laugher with you.
						<br /><br /> It is basicallly a <b>Meme</b> app.
						<br />
					</p>

					<h3>Specially crafted for Filipino audience</h3>
					<br />
					<p>According to the recent <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-philippines"
							target="_blank">studies</a>. Facebook had 86.75 million users in the Philippines in early
						2024. This app is specially tailored for these users. Facebook is great, but since it used by
						too many cultures around the world, it fails to capture Filipino-specific needs.
						That is why you will notice in the app and website, it is littered with Tagalog and sometimes
						beki language, to make Filipinos feel at home.</p>

					<br /><br />
					<h3>What are problems we are trying to address?</h3>
					<br />
					<br />
					<h4>Privacy of your Personal Data</h4>
					<br />
					<p>Filipinos should be able to consume and publish contents without sacrificing their privacy. We
						strongly discourage providing your real information when signing up an account, posting your
						whereabouts, your family photos etc.
						This is a platform to post funny videos of cats, memes and jokes. Generally anything that is not
						too personal.
					</p>

					<h4>Other platforms is going through the process of <i>Enshittification</i></h4>
					<br />
					<p>
					<blockquote style="margin-left:10px;"><b>Enshittification</b>, also known as crapification and
						platform decay, is the term used to describe the pattern in which online products and services
						decline in quality over time. Initially, vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users,
						then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their
						services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders.</blockquote>
					This platform is a fresh take, free from the toxic stuffs going on in the bureaucracy of large
					social media platforms like Meta or X. We dont really have shareholders to kiss ass, so pretty much
					everything you would like us to have in this app, we can give it to you.
					</p>

					<h4>What this app is not</h4>
					<br />
					<p>
						This app is NOT a news app, everything you might find here is most likely a joke and not meant
						to be taken seriously.
						<br />
					</p>


					<h4>Just Fun and good vibes</h4>
					<br />
					<p>
						Politics, activism, hatred and emotionally negative posts has no place in this app.
						<br />
						If you want to debate with someone else about Politics, go to X.
						<br />

						If you are resentful with your family, wife, husband, friends goverment and so on. Post that
						shit in Facebook.
						<br />

						If you want to post your food or half-naked photos, post that shit in Instagram or TikTok
						<br />

						This app is for funny contents, not for other shit.
					</p>

					<h3>How do we earn money from this app?</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						Primarily through those annoying ads. Mostly through Google AdMob, sometimes when you are
						browsing through posts, there are ads, we clearly indicates it though so that you were aware
						that it is an ad.
